# Codecademy: WorkAround Explorer

In this Codecademy project, I was tasked with creating a web application for a research organization called WorkAround. This web app's main goal was to provide data on salary trends in the tech industry. The app let users select different roles and companies to compare the difference in salaries for each position.

## Objective

WorkAround wanted their web app - named WorkAround Explorer - to allow users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry and view the following information:

* The salary for the chosen role at the chosen company.
* The industry average for the chosen role.
* The average salary at the chosen company across all roles.
* The industry average salary across all roles and all companies.

## Launch
